## CTG restaurant pos fullstack

Hello there!

Thank you for downloading this project and welcome!

This is a study project created for the students of the CTG mentorship program ran by Vinicius Pessoni (Vinny Pessoni @pessonizando)

It simulates a software for restaurantes POS (point of services), 
like those they use to make your orders when you are in a table
or the waiters would use to send your order to the kitchen.

Its comprised of:
* **frontend** done in typescript, react, nextjs. 
* **backend** done in java and springboot

Feel free to clone, fork and use this for your studies!

## What you will need and how to run

You will need to have DOCKER installed in your machine,
as I created this front end and backend to run in a dockerized environment to make it easy for you to run and study!


* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

To run the entire stack, after cloning the project, simply go to the folder in terminal and do:
```plaintext
docker-compose up --build
```

The api will be running in the port 8080 and acessible through

* http://localhost:8080/

Go ahead and hit the endpoint to try, and you should see a list of foods available prepopulated. 

* http://localhost:8080/api/food-items

The frontend will be running in 
    
* http://localhost:3000/

When you hit you should see the app for the pos. 

Hope you have a great journey studying it!
